# World-Population-Dashboard
Purpose of the dashboard and intended users:
Currently the population of the world is standing at a staggering 7.67 Billion. This is an explanatory dashboard shows the population of the top 3 most populated countries of the world, and explores some of the demographics. This helps us to visually understand the population explosion and how the population of each sex has increased or decreased over the years. This visualization shows the data of the last 60 years in the intervals of 10 years, from 1960 to 2019.
The intended users of this dashboard will be: <br />
a) Socio-economic researchers, politicians, and lawmakers who are doing a research on the population distribution of the world, gender gap, income wise population of the world, etc. <br />
b) General audience or students who are interested in the population distribution of the world and the demographics to reuse it for some project, research or for general interest. <br />

### Data Selection:
The data has been taken from the world bank database, using the following link:
Source: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL?end=2019&locations=1W&most_recent_year_desc=true&start=1960&view=chart
3 files have been used from this course, they are as follows: <br />
i. Population of the world <br />
ii. Population of Female <br />
iii. Population of Male <br />

### Data Cleaning:
The data had a column for country code and one for ID which has been removed. The file has a country metadata in a separate sheet with the region and income type of the country, it has been merged with the main sheet to each country. This has been done for all 3 files.

### Details of the variables:
